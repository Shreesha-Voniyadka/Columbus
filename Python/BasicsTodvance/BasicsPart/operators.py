Arithmetic:             (-),(+),(*),[/(float)],[//(floor)],(%),(**)
                        Follows PEMDAS - para,Exponents, Multiply, Division, addition, substarction
Relational/comparison:  (>),(<),(==),(!=),(>=),(<=)
                        returns bool values
Logical:                and, or , not

Bitwise:                & - Result bit 1,if both operand bits are 1;otherwise results bit 0.
                        | - Result bit 1,if any of the operand bit is 1; otherwise results bit 0. 
                        ~ - inverts individual bits.
                        ^ - Results bit 1,if any of the operand bit is 1 but not both, otherwise results bit 0.
                        >> - The left operand's value is moved toward right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
                        << - The left operand's value is moved toward left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
