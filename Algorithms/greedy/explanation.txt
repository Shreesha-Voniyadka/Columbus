======================== ALGORITHM : GREEDY ==============================

Solving the optimisation problem in effective way taking decision that result in most evident and immediate benefit 

It is called “greedy” because it tries to find the best solution by making the best choice at each step, 
without considering future steps or the consequences of the current decision.

The greedy algorithm is a method used in optimization problems 
where the goal is to make the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum

Summary : optimising the problem without thinking consequences by taking a decision at that moment

Use cases : 
    1. Allocations (Think about os schedulers)
    2. Minimum spanning trees( Graphs )
    3. Coin Change problem 
    4. Huffman ( details are required)
