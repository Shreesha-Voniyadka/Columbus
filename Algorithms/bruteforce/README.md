# Brute Force Algorithm 
<p>It is an intuitive, direct, and straightforward technique of problem-solving in which all the possible ways or all the possible solutions to a given problem are enumerated.</p>
<p> This is the first basic algorthm i am going to master </p>
<p>The brute force approach is inefficient. For real-time problems, algorithm analysis often goes above the O(N!) order of growth. 
Mainly it is slow</p>
